The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the Spark marketplace application by systematically addressing a series of critical production bugs, primarily focusing on login, campaign management, and overall UI responsiveness. A recurring theme was infinite loading or timeout issues, initially for login, then for campaign creation/editing, and subsequently for creator-specific functionalities like signup, profile save, and rate card/application submissions. The engineer demonstrated an iterative debugging approach, often utilizing troubleshooting agents and direct console log analysis on the live site to identify discrepancies between automated tests and real-world user experiences (e.g., production mode vs. development mode, network conditions, Supabase client timeouts). Key architectural decisions involved implementing client-side caching (), robust timeout mechanisms, and re-routing direct Supabase calls through Next.js API routes to mitigate CORS and network issues. Git repository corruption was also encountered and resolved during deployment. By the end, most critical path issues were resolved, leaving only minor UI polish and real data integration for later.

Spark is a production-ready MVP for a KOL & Creator marketplace built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase. It supports role-based user management (Creators, Brands, Admin), a redesigned homepage, robust authentication (OAuth, RLS, no email confirmation), and functional Campaign and Application systems.

The core problem addressed is the creation of a comprehensive transactional marketplace layer, which includes:
- Dynamic pricing via KOL rate cards and a live cost estimator.
- Full offer and acceptance workflows.
- Escrow payments using Stripe (Checkout, Connect) with a 20% platform fee and webhook handling.
- Anti-disintermediation features: contact masking, message sanitization, and gated file sharing.
- Admin controls for managing fees, payment release, refunds, and manual payouts.
- A fallback system for manual payouts.

Throughout the development, the focus has been on preserving existing MVP functionalities (authentication, dashboards, campaigns, messaging) while resolving critical bugs encountered during manual testing. These included recurring infinite loading and timeout issues across login, signup, campaign creation/editing, and profile/rate card/application save operations, along with ensuring consistent data persistence and UI updates.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Next.js 14**: Full-stack React framework with server/client components and API routes.
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui**: Utility-first CSS and UI component library for styling.
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), and Row Level Security.
- **Stripe**: Payment gateway for transactional marketplace features (escrow, checkout).
- **Local Storage**: Client-side caching for data persistence (e.g., ).
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for sensitive data and URLs.
- **API Routes**: Next.js backend endpoints ( prefixed) for server-side logic and data fetching.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Next.js directory structure, organized into  (for pages and API routes) and  (for reusable UI modules),  (for utilities and database interactions), and other configuration files.



**Key Files Modified/Created in this Trajectory:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles user login and redirects.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed login timeout logic (increased timeout, enhanced error handling, AbortController for Supabase). Refactored DOM manipulation to use React state. Added logout option. Most recently, fixed Go to Dashboard button to dynamically redirect based on user role rather than hardcoding to brand dashboard.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles user registration.
    -   **Changes**: Addressed infinite loading bugs. Implemented robust redirect logic, fixed race conditions, improved error display, and added timeout protection.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes Supabase client interactions for data fetching and mutations.
    -   **Changes**: Added  and  functions (later modified). Added environment variable validation. Crucially, removed  from  and other campaign/rate card/offer/payment/payout-related functions to ensure array format responses and prevent infinite loading/crashes. Configured Supabase client with a 25-second timeout for all requests using AbortController.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Newly created utility for consistent  cache management of campaign data.
    -   **Changes**: Added  function to synchronize campaign status updates and ensure immediate UI reflection. Provides functions for adding, removing, updating, and clearing campaign data in cache.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Page for editing existing campaigns.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use  for immediate cache synchronization after status changes. Fixed redirect to go back to  dashboard.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Admin interface for managing campaigns and users.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  to ensure that campaign status updates made by admins reflect immediately across the platform.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main dashboard for Brand users.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed Show Tutorial button by correcting the function name from  to  to correctly interact with . Added null checks to campaign mapping for robustness.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main dashboard for Creator users.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed Show Tutorial button by correcting the function name from  to . Added null checks to campaign mapping for robustness.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays campaigns relevant to Creator users.
    -   **Changes**: Addressed Application error: a client-side exception by implementing comprehensive null checks, error handling, and safe array operations in campaign rendering. Temporarily added sample data loading with a delay for debugging purposes.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Newly created Next.js API route to fetch campaigns, to bypass client-side CORS/security restrictions when accessing Supabase directly from the browser.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented as a proxy for  to handle server-side data fetching for the Creator campaigns page.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Supervisor configuration for running Next.js application.
    -   **Changes**: Changed  to  to ensure the application runs in production mode.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing for the transactional layer (beyond initial bug fixes).
- Creation of comprehensive documentation, including an operator runbook.
- **Show Tutorial Button**: Fix the issue where the button is visible but clicking it doesn't open the onboarding modal (React context communication issue).
- **Go to Dashboard Button**: Fix the convenience feature on the login page where it doesn't trigger redirect when already logged in.
- **Creator Campaigns - Real Data Integration**: Integrate real Supabase campaign data instead of temporary sample/mock data.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a persistent Application error: a client-side exception has occurred on the  page. This bug was initially reported by the user, and although the AI engineer believed it was fixed by adding comprehensive null checks and restructuring the page, the user reported it was still occurring even after clearing browser cache.

The AI engineer's most recent investigation (Chat 564-565) revealed that the Application error itself was, in fact, **resolved**. The screenshot was showing Loading... and console logs confirmed Sample campaigns loaded: 2 and Setting loading to false. The root cause of the perceived stuck state was an **intentional 1-second delay** () that was introduced in the sample data loading logic () within  for debugging purposes. This delay caused the page to appear to be stuck on loading even though the JavaScript error was gone.

The current state is that the JavaScript error is fixed, and the page is correctly displaying a loading state, with sample data eventually appearing after the intentional delay.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Remove the intentional 1-second loading delay from the Creator campaigns page.
