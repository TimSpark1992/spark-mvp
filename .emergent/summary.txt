The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing the Spark marketplace application by resolving a series of critical production bugs, predominantly infinite loading and Application error: a client-side exception has occurred issues. The process was highly iterative, demonstrating persistence in diagnosing elusive problems. Key debugging shifts included moving from code-level assumptions to requesting direct browser console errors, which revealed the true root causes like Select component validation and, more critically, build cache/environment variable conflicts, and even server startup mode mismatches.

Architectural decisions included centralizing utility functions (e.g., ), implementing robust client-side loading patterns with timeouts and  flags for state management, and systematically applying fixes across relevant parts of the codebase (especially Creator-side pages). The engineer also identified and rectified infrastructure-level problems such as incorrect environment variable usage and missing database tables. Authentication-related issues, including Supabase SSR hydration and base URL configuration, were also addressed. This systematic approach, although sometimes lengthy due to misdiagnoses, ultimately led to significant stability improvements.

Spark is an MVP for a KOL & Creator marketplace built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase. It features role-based user management (Creators, Brands, Admin), an updated homepage, and robust authentication with OAuth and Row Level Security. The core problem is establishing a comprehensive transactional marketplace layer with dynamic pricing via KOL rate cards, live cost estimation, and full offer/acceptance workflows. It integrates Stripe for escrow payments (20% platform fee, webhook handling), includes anti-disintermediation features (contact masking, message sanitization, gated file sharing), and admin controls for fees, payment release, refunds, and manual payouts. The development has prioritized preserving existing MVP functionalities (authentication, dashboards, campaigns, messaging) while resolving critical bugs like infinite loading and timeout issues in login, signup, campaign management, and profile/rate card/application submissions, ensuring consistent data persistence and UI updates.

<pending_tasks>
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing for the transactional layer (beyond initial bug fixes).
- Creation of comprehensive documentation, including an operator runbook.
- **Show Tutorial Button**: Fix the issue where the button is visible but clicking it doesn't open the onboarding modal (React context communication issue). (Was verified as working, but may need re-validation if other changes affected it).
- **Go to Dashboard Button**: Fix the convenience feature on the login page where it doesn't trigger redirect when already logged in. (Was verified as working, but may need re-validation).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was systematically addressing persistent data validation and display issues across the Creator section of the application. Specifically, after resolving a recurring /bin/bash.00 price display bug that appeared when editing rate cards, it was determined that the root cause was an overly broad null/undefined check () in the  utility, combined with remnants of local formatting functions overriding centralized ones.

The AI engineer's most recent actions (Chat 347-352) involved a comprehensive search for similar problematic patterns throughout the entire  directory, including:
- Multiple instances of  functions.
- Inconsistent validation logic using  patterns for numbers (e.g., , ).
- Direct usage of  without robust null/undefined checks for dates.

The engineer confirmed that such issues exist in multiple files and decided to systematically fix them by centralizing formatting utilities in  and ensuring all relevant components import and use these robust functions. The work is currently ongoing, with the engineer having identified  as one of the files needing attention for systematic fixes.
