The AI engineer successfully transformed the Spark MVP from concept to a fully functional application. The initial phase focused on scaffolding the Next.js app with Tailwind CSS, integrating Supabase for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), and storage. Core components like the homepage, navigation, login/signup flows, and basic Creator/Brand dashboards were rapidly developed. A significant portion of the trajectory involved persistent debugging of Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies, which initially blocked user profile creation post-signup. This iterative process led to the discovery that the primary issue wasn't the RLS policies themselves, but rather Supabase's default email confirmation setting preventing immediate session establishment. Once this was identified and the user disabled email confirmation, the core authentication and profile creation flows became fully functional. Subsequently, the Admin Panel was implemented, completing all specified user roles. The project then transitioned to an E-1 Optimization phase, hardening security (route guards, security headers), refactoring forms, and preparing for deployment. The current focus is on implementing comprehensive XSS protection, with the core XSS sanitization functions working but requiring full integration into all user input forms, specifically the critical signup form, which is the immediate next step.

<product_requirements>
The Spark MVP is a KOL & Creator Marketplace Platform connecting Brands with Creators. Brands post campaign briefs, and Creators apply. An Admin moderates the platform.
**Key Features:**
- **User Roles:** Creator, Brand, Admin with Supabase Auth and Google OAuth. Users select roles on signup and are routed to appropriate dashboards.
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL for  (user data),  (brand briefs),  (creator applications). Supabase Storage for media.
- **Pages/Features:** Homepage (hero, features, CTAs), Brand Dashboard (campaign list, post campaign, view applications, profile), Campaign Brief Form (fields, validation), Creator Dashboard (profile setup, campaign feed, apply flow, applications tracker), Admin Panel (user/campaign management).
- **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, clean responsive layout, specific brand colors.
**Development Phases & Current State:**
- **MVP (Initial Build):** Fully functional homepage, authentication (login/signup with Google OAuth), role-based dashboards, and Supabase integration were initially built. The database schema and RLS policies were provided as SQL for manual setup by the user.
- **RLS Bug Resolution:** A prolonged debugging effort resolved critical RLS policy issues that prevented profile creation during signup. The root cause was eventually identified as Supabase's Email Confirmations setting blocking immediate session establishment, which was fixed by disabling it.
- **End-to-End Flow & Admin Panel:** All core user flows (Creator, Brand, Admin) were simulated and confirmed fully functional, including the newly implemented Admin Panel.
- **E-1 Optimization:** The application underwent a production readiness phase, including security hardening (route guards, security headers), form refactoring, and deployment preparation.
- **Current Task (XSS Protection):** Implementing XSS protection across all user input fields using  on the frontend and backend validation.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Next.js:** React framework for full-stack application development.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-Service providing PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Supabase feature for fine-grained access control on database rows.
- ** / :** Libraries for sanitizing HTML to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Shadcn/ui:** Reusable UI components for Next.js.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Next.js project structure, organized for clear separation of concerns between pages, components, and backend API routes.



-   ****: The main homepage, serving as the entry point with hero section, features, testimonials, and CTAs.
-   ****: The root layout for the Next.js application, defining the overall structure and including global styles.
-   ****: The main Next.js API route handler, designed to manage various backend operations (though it was noted to still contain MongoDB-related logic despite Supabase integration).
-   ****: Stores environment variables like Supabase URL and Anon Key.
-   ****: Contains the Supabase client initialization and helper functions for database interactions and authentication.
-   ****: A series of SQL scripts (, , , , , , , , ) used to define and correct the Supabase database schema, including tables (, , ) and Row Level Security (RLS) policies. These were iteratively fixed and refined to resolve persistent RLS policy errors during user signup.
-   ****: Handles user registration, including role selection, Google OAuth integration, and initial profile creation. This file has undergone significant changes to correctly handle Supabase sessions and integrate XSS protection.
-   ****: A newly created utility file responsible for frontend sanitization using  and backend validation for user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
-   ****: Contains enhanced validation logic, now integrated with XSS protection.
-   ****: Implemented during the E-1 optimization phase for enhanced route protection and access control based on user roles.
-   ** / **: Refactored components for authentication and campaign creation, now including XSS sanitization for their respective input fields.

<pending_tasks>
- Minor UX improvements: Directly redirect users to their dashboards after signup instead of the homepage.
- Resolve minor HTTP 406 errors during profile data retrieval (currently non-blocking).
- Fully integrate XSS protection into the main signup form, as it's currently only integrated into the campaign creation form.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work revolves around implementing comprehensive XSS protection across all user input fields. This became a critical task after the E-1 optimization phase identified an incomplete XSS protection implementation, leaving the application vulnerable.

So far, the AI engineer has:
1.  **Installed necessary packages:**  and .
2.  **Created XSS utility functions:** In  and updated  to include sanitization and validation logic.
3.  **Integrated XSS protection into some areas:**
    *   : The campaign creation form has been updated to sanitize user inputs for campaign titles, descriptions, and other fields using the new XSS protection utilities. Initial testing confirmed XSS protection is working perfectly for this form.
    *    and  have also been updated to use the new validation.
    *    was inspected, but its role in the Supabase-backed app seems unclear (it still contains MongoDB logic), so XSS integration there might need re-evaluation.
4.  **Developed an XSS test suite:**  was created to systematically test the effectiveness of the XSS protection.

The current state is that while XSS protection functions are robust and effective where integrated (e.g., campaign creation), there's a **critical vulnerability**: the main signup form () is *not yet* integrated with XSS protection, allowing dangerous scripts to pass through. The AI engineer is at the point of integrating XSS protection into this crucial signup form.
