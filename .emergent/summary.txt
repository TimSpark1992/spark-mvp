The previous AI engineer systematically addressed a series of critical bugs in the Spark marketplace application. Initially, the focus was on pervasive infinite loading and Application error issues, which were traced to client-side validation, build cache inconsistencies, environment variable conflicts, and server startup modes. A key architectural decision involved centralizing utility functions (e.g., ) and implementing robust client-side loading patterns with  flags and timeouts.

The debugging process was iterative, moving from code assumptions to direct console errors to uncover root causes. Significant efforts were directed towards resolving complex issues like Internal server error during rate card updates, which was ultimately linked to incorrect Supabase client key usage (anonymous vs. service role) and Row Level Security policies. Frontend UI/UX bugs, such as the persistent 0 prefix in price inputs and non-functional increment buttons, were resolved by refactoring state management to store dollar values directly and convert to cents only on submission. User experience disruptions, including overly aggressive loading timeouts and space removal in text fields, were meticulously fixed by refining loading logic and postponing XSS sanitization from real-time typing to form submission. The final reported issue was a TypeError: r is not a function during file uploads, which was traced to missing function availability checks and storage configuration, leading to a robust upload implementation.

<product_requirements>
Spark is an MVP for a KOL & Creator marketplace built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase. It features role-based user management (Creators, Brands, Admin), an updated homepage, and robust authentication with OAuth and Row Level Security. The core problem is establishing a comprehensive transactional marketplace layer with dynamic pricing via KOL rate cards, live cost estimation, and full offer/acceptance workflows. It integrates Stripe for escrow payments (20% platform fee, webhook handling), includes anti-disintermediation features (contact masking, message sanitization, gated file sharing), and admin controls for fees, payment release, refunds, and manual payouts. The development has prioritized preserving existing MVP functionalities (authentication, dashboards, campaigns, messaging) while resolving critical bugs like infinite loading and timeout issues in login, signup, campaign management, and profile/rate card/application submissions, ensuring consistent data persistence and UI updates.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug related to file uploads (Profile Picture and Media Kit) on the Creator Profile page (). The user reported a TypeError: r is not a function along with general issues with upload functionality.

The investigation revealed that the error stemmed from:
1.  **Missing function availability checks**: The  and  functions were being called without verifying they were properly imported or available.
2.  **Suboptimal error handling**: Cryptic minified JavaScript errors were obscuring the real issues.
3.  **Potential storage configuration problems**: Specifically, the Supabase storage buckets ('profiles' and 'media-kits') might not have been correctly set up.
4.  **Filename issues**: Special characters in filenames were causing upload failures.

To resolve this, the AI engineer implemented a robust upload solution:
-   **Enhanced Function Availability Checks**: Added explicit checks () before invoking upload utilities.
-   **Improved Error Handling & Logging**: Incorporated comprehensive, emoji-based console logging to track progress (, , ) and provide specific error messages for different failure scenarios.
-   **Enhanced File Upload Functions**: Integrated filename sanitization (replacing special characters with underscores) and included checks for storage bucket existence and URL validation.
-   **Storage Configuration Reference**: Identified  as the script for configuring the necessary Supabase storage buckets ('profiles' and 'media-kits').

The backend testing for the upload infrastructure has been completed successfully, confirming that the API routes and supporting functions are working correctly and are ready for the frontend to utilize them. The TypeError: r is not a function should now be resolved, with clear progress and error feedback in the browser console during uploads.
