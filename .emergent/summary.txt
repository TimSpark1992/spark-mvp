The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Spark marketplace to production-ready status, as detailed in the initial summary. However, ongoing manual testing revealed critical UI and data persistence bugs that the AI engineer systematically addressed. These included fixing navigation issues, button functionalities, design inconsistencies, dynamic onboarding progress, and campaign data persistence via  and a new  utility. Profile editing and message loading bugs were also resolved.

The recent focus shifted to a recurring infinite loading during signup bug, which also manifested as login request timed out issues. The AI engineer made several attempts to fix this, often encountering race conditions, redirect logic problems, and environment variable loading issues. A significant challenge arose from discrepancies between the AI's automated tests (which often reported success) and the user's real-world experience on the production environment, highlighting a critical need for production-specific debugging and deployment. The latest interaction confirms a persistent login timeout on production, as evidenced by a user-provided screen recording, contradicting the AI's previous conclusion of a successful fix. This indicates a deeper, environment-specific authentication problem requiring further investigation.

<product_requirements>
Spark is a Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase-based KOL & Creator marketplace, developed as a production-ready MVP. It features role-based user management (Creators, Brands, Admin), a redesigned homepage, robust authentication (OAuth, RLS, no email confirmation), and functional Campaign and Application systems. Earlier efforts addressed initial bugs in signup flows and profile 404s.

The application was expanded to include a comprehensive transactional marketplace layer, which consists of:
- Dynamic pricing via KOL rate cards and a live cost estimator.
- Full offer and acceptance workflows.
- Escrow payments using Stripe (Checkout, Connect) with a 20% platform fee and webhook handling.
- Anti-disintermediation features such as contact masking, message sanitization, and gated file sharing.
- Admin controls for managing fees, payment release, refunds, and manual payouts.
- A fallback system for manual payouts.
The development work ensures the preservation of existing MVP functionalities like authentication, dashboards, campaigns, and messaging.

-   ****: Handles authentication-based redirects.
    -   **Changes**: Initially modified to only redirect authenticated users from homepage (). Later, updated to *prevent* redirects when on specific authentication pages (, , etc.) to allow users to see auth forms even when logged in.
-   ****: Ensures role-based access to pages.
    -   **Changes**: Displays an unauthorized message with options instead of automatically redirecting for incorrect roles.
-   ****: Lists all campaigns for a brand.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented  caching for persistence and updated  to remove from cache immediately.
-   ****: **NEWLY CREATED** utility for consistent cache management.
    -   **Changes**: Provides functions (, , , , ) for managing campaign data in .
-   ****: Brand user's profile editing page.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed category unselect, infinite loading on Save Profile, and forced redirects. Implemented success/error modals. Fixed brand logo not updating visually post-upload. Added logic for first-time profile completion to redirect to dashboard.

    -   **Changes**: Added 10-second timeout and improved error handling for API calls.
-   ****: Signup form.
    -   **Changes**: Addressed infinite loading bugs with multiple iterations. Implemented robust redirect logic using Next.js router and  fallbacks, fixed race conditions with profile creation, improved error display, and added timeout protection.
-   ****: Login form.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed login timeout logic (reducing it). Implemented better visual feedback for login (loading, success states, clear messages). Refactored DOM manipulation to use React state. Added a logout option and status display for authenticated users on the login page. Modified redirect to go directly to dashboard.
-   ****: Supabase client utilities.

<pending_tasks>
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing for the entire transactional layer (partially completed, but specific bugs required manual intervention).
- Creation of comprehensive documentation, including an operator runbook.
- Investigate and fix the recurring Login request timed out issue on the production environment, especially the discrepancy between automated test results and actual user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into resolving a recurring and critical Login request timed out issue on the *production* environment (). This bug was particularly challenging because the AI's automated frontend tests () consistently showed the login succeeding and redirecting to the dashboard with no issues. However, the user provided a screen recording (Chat 383) that unequivocally demonstrated the Login request timed out error persisted, with the login button stuck on Signing in... indefinitely and the user never reaching the dashboard.

This direct contradiction revealed a significant gap: the automated testing environment or methodology was not accurately reflecting the real-world production user experience. The AI engineer had previously implemented numerous fixes for similar timeout and redirect issues in the *development* environment, including robust redirect logic (using Next.js router with  fallbacks), environment variable loading fixes, improved loading and success feedback, and preventing jarring auto-redirects/onboarding modals on auth pages. All these fixes were confirmed to work in the development environment and had recently been successfully deployed to production after resolving a build error caused by accidental XML tags in .

The current state is that the AI engineer has acknowledged its previous incorrect conclusion about the login being fixed and is now preparing to thoroughly investigate the root cause of the discrepancy between its tests and the user's reported, visually confirmed, production timeout issue. This will likely involve deeper debugging into network conditions, specific browser behaviors on production, or server-side interactions that are not captured by current automated tests.
