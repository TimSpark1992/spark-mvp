The previous AI engineer diligently tackled various critical bugs in the Spark marketplace application, spanning from persistent UI issues like infinite loading and Application error to complex backend problems such as Internal server error during rate card updates. Solutions involved architectural decisions like centralizing utility functions (), implementing robust client-side loading patterns, and correctly configuring Supabase (e.g., using service role client for RLS bypass). UI/UX bugs, including price input inconsistencies and non-functional buttons, were addressed by refactoring state management and input handling. XSS sanitization was refined to enhance user experience without removing spaces. Most recently, the focus was on a TypeError: r is not a function during file uploads on the Creator Profile. The previous engineer implemented fixes including function availability checks, filename sanitization, and improved error handling, believing the issue was resolved. However, the user's latest message explicitly states that this specific error persists for profile picture uploads, indicating that the problem is still active and requires further investigation.

<product_requirements>
Spark is an MVP for a KOL & Creator marketplace built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase. It features role-based user management (Creators, Brands, Admin), an updated homepage, and robust authentication with OAuth and Row Level Security. The core problem is establishing a comprehensive transactional marketplace layer with dynamic pricing via KOL rate cards, live cost estimation, and full offer/acceptance workflows. It integrates Stripe for escrow payments (20% platform fee, webhook handling), includes anti-disintermediation features (contact masking, message sanitization, gated file sharing), and admin controls for fees, payment release, refunds, and manual payouts. The development has prioritized preserving existing MVP functionalities (authentication, dashboards, campaigns, messaging) while resolving critical bugs like infinite loading and timeout issues in login, signup, campaign management, and profile/rate card/application submissions, ensuring consistent data persistence and UI updates.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Next.js 14: Full-stack React framework with server/client components and API routes.
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui: Utility-first CSS and UI component library for styling.
- Supabase: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), and Row Level Security.
- Stripe: Payment gateway for transactional marketplace features (escrow, checkout).
- Environment Variables: Secure configuration.
- API Routes: Next.js backend endpoints.
- SSR Hydration: Handling server-side rendering.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Next.js directory structure, organized into  (for pages and API routes) and  (for reusable UI modules),  (for utilities and database interactions), and other configuration files.



-   ****: Handles user login and redirects. Login redirection logic was verified.
-   ****: Centralizes Supabase client interactions. Fixed SSR hydration, added array handling to . Crucially, configured a Supabase service role client for backend operations to bypass Row Level Security issues and ensure proper session persistence.
-   ****: Displays campaigns for Creator users. Fixed Application error with Select component, integrated Supabase data, and applied robust loading patterns (, timeout, ).
-   ****: Displays Creator applications. Applied robust loading patterns and  for UI consistency.
-   ****: Manages Creator rate cards. Applied robust loading patterns. Fixed  and Invalid Date formatting using centralized formatters. Fixed /bin/bash.00 display. Addressed infinite loading by optimizing  dependencies and authentication timeout. Overhauled input fields (Base Price, Rush Fee) to store dollar values and convert to cents on submission. Replaced  with a custom modal.
-   ****: Displays Creator offers. Applied robust loading patterns and /.
-   ****: Main dashboard for Creator users. Verified Show Tutorial button logic and applied .
-   ****: Protects routes based on user roles. Fixed parameter mismatch ( vs. ) and optimized authentication redirect loading duration.
-   ****: Supervisor configuration. Changed  to .
-   ****: Environment variables. Updated  to .
-   ****: Local environment variables. Added  and fixed corrupted .
-   ** (Newly created)**: Centralized utility for formatting prices, dates, and percentages with robust checks.
-   ****: Handles API requests for individual rate cards. Improved  validation and error logging. Fixed Supabase RLS issue by using a service role client.
-   ****: Handles XSS protection. Enhanced sanitization to preserve spaces/line breaks.
-   ****: Creator's public profile management. Fixed space removal error in Bio by moving  to . Implemented profile picture and media kit upload functionality, addressing TypeError: r is not a function by adding function availability checks, filename sanitization, and error handling.
-   ****: SQL script for setting up Supabase storage buckets ('profiles', 'media-kits').

<pending_tasks>
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing for the transactional layer.
- Creation of comprehensive documentation, including an operator runbook.
- **Show Tutorial Button**: Fix the issue where clicking the button doesn't open the onboarding modal (React context communication issue).
- **Go to Dashboard Button**: Fix the login page convenience feature that doesn't trigger redirect when already logged in.
- **Supabase Storage Buckets**: Ensure 'profiles' and 'media-kits' buckets are configured (as per ).
- **Profile Picture Upload**: Address the persistent TypeError: r is not a function error preventing profile picture uploads on the Creator Profile page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug related to file uploads (Profile Picture and Media Kit) on the Creator Profile page (). The user reported a TypeError: r is not a function along with general issues with upload functionality. The previous investigation revealed the error stemmed from missing function availability checks, suboptimal error handling, potential storage configuration problems, and filename issues. A robust upload solution was implemented, including enhanced function availability checks, improved emoji-based error handling and logging, enhanced file upload functions with filename sanitization, and identification of  for configuring Supabase storage buckets. The previous report indicated that backend testing was completed and the TypeError: r is not a function should be resolved. However, the user's most recent feedback indicates the error persists on the frontend, preventing profile picture uploads.

<optional_next_step>
Re-investigate and fix the persistent TypeError: r is not a function error for profile picture uploads.
