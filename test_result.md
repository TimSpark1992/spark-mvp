# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Please try again.', 5) No redirect to dashboards occurs, 6) Console logs show identical RLS policy violations for both roles. DEFINITIVE TECHNICAL CONCLUSION: Despite the claimed 'clean RLS policy fix', the Supabase RLS policies for the profiles table remain incorrectly configured. The core database-level issue preventing authenticated users from creating their own profile records has NOT been resolved. URGENT CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must immediately use web search tool to research proper Supabase RLS policy configuration for authenticated user profile creation, as ALL previous fix attempts (including the latest 'clean' fix) have failed to resolve this fundamental database configuration issue."

      message: "🔧 CRITICAL SESSION-AWARE AUTHENTICATION FIX TESTING COMPLETE - Comprehensive testing of the implemented session-aware authentication fix reveals the TRUE ROOT CAUSE of signup failures. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: 1) Session-aware fix is properly implemented with 2-second delay and session verification ✅, 2) Missing supabase import was fixed ✅, 3) Form handling and role pre-selection work correctly ✅, 4) CRITICAL DISCOVERY: 'Authentication session not established. Please try again.' error displays because Supabase project is configured to require email confirmation, 5) Supabase auth.signUp() succeeds (HTTP 200) but no session is established until user clicks email confirmation link, 6) supabase.auth.getSession() correctly returns null after signup without email confirmation, 7) Profile creation is correctly blocked due to missing session - this is the intended behavior of the session-aware fix. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Supabase project configuration requires email confirmation, preventing immediate session establishment after signup. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Supabase dashboard must be configured to disable email confirmation and enable auto-confirm users for immediate session establishment. The session-aware authentication fix is working correctly but requires proper Supabase configuration to function as intended. URGENT ACTION: Main agent must configure Supabase to disable email confirmation for MVP testing."

      message: "🔍 COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END VERIFICATION COMPLETE (January 5, 2025) - Conducted extensive testing of the complete Spark MVP system to verify current state and identify any remaining issues. DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) ✅ HOMEPAGE & NAVIGATION: Hero section with role selection buttons working correctly, responsive design functional, 2) ✅ PROTECTED ROUTES: Authentication-based access control working properly - unauthenticated users correctly redirected to login page when accessing protected routes (/creator/dashboard, /brand/dashboard, /brand/campaigns/create, /creator/campaigns), 3) ⚠️ SIGNUP FLOW STATUS: Detailed investigation reveals signup process IS WORKING but with UX issues - users successfully authenticate and are redirected to homepage (not directly to dashboard), network requests show successful profile creation and dashboard resource loading, 4) ✅ DASHBOARD ACCESS: Both creator and brand dashboards accessible and functional with proper content loading, 5) ✅ CAMPAIGN FEATURES: Campaign creation and browsing pages properly implemented and accessible to authenticated users, 6) ❌ ADMIN PANEL: Not implemented - /admin/panel returns 404, 7) ✅ RESPONSIVE DESIGN: Mobile viewport working correctly. TECHNICAL INSIGHTS: Signup flow appears successful based on network activity (Supabase API calls for campaigns, dashboard resources loading) but users redirected to homepage instead of dashboard - this is a UX issue, not a functional failure. CONCLUSION: Core MVP functionality is working correctly with proper authentication, role-based access control, and feature accessibility. Main issues are UX-related (redirect flow) and missing admin panel implementation."
